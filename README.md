## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Vite
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animations

### What I learned

- Using JavaScript to manipulate DOM
- CSS Grid
- Vite
- Basics of CSS animations

### Continued development

What can be added in the future:

- Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

What to focus on in future projects:

- Better organization of JavaScript.
